This package implements methods for pose-following of manipulators (e.g., articulated arms) where the end-effector of a manipulator follows a given pose stream (e.g., from a haptic interface). The package also includes utility interfaces to move the manipulator to a desired end-effector pose through services.

The package can be used for example to teleoperate a manipulator using a haptic interface or other device.

### Nodes:

#### `pose_following`:
The main node facilitating pose-following.  


- *Subscribed topics*:  
    - `pose_following/cmd_vel` - (geometry_msgs/Twist)  
      The pose derivative expressed as twist.  
    - `pose_following/pose` - (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped)  
      The current pose of the device used for pose-following. The pose derivative is calculated internally.
    - `joint_states` - (sensor_msgs/JointState)  
      The current joint states of the manipulator.  
- *Published topics*:  
    - `joint_command` - (trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory)  
      See http://wiki.ros.org/Industrial/Industrial_Robot_Driver_Spec  
- *Services*:  
    - `/pose_following/start`  
      Enables the node to accept pose or pose derivative messages.  
    - `/pose_following/stop`  
      Sets the node to an idle state where pose or pose derivative messages are ignored.  
- *Parameters*:  
    - `rate` - (`int`, default: 100) [Hz]  
      The node's sampling rate  
    - `group` - (`string`, default: 'manipulator')  
      The name of the manipulator group.  
    - `w0` - (`double`, default: 0.1)  
      Factor determining the proximity to a singularity (see [Nakamura *et al.*](http://dynamicsystems.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1403812)).  
    - `k0` - (`double`, default: 0.001)  
      Adjustment factor to inverse of Jacobian in proximity of a simgularity (see [Nakamura *et al.*](http://dynamicsystems.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1403812)).  
    - `theta_d_lim` - (`double`, default: 3.14) [rad/s]  
      Joint velocity limit threshold. If exceeded, the node's state changes to idle.  
    - `dt_pose_lim` - (`double`, default: 0.5) [s]  
      `if(dt_cb > dt_pose_lim): STATE_POSE_FOLLOW --> STATE_IDLE`: If the most recent `pose` or `cmd_vel` message has been received more than `dt_pose_lim` s ago, transition to state `STATE_IDLE`.
